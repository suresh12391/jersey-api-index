Steps to create/update the jersey-api-index html page.

NOTE: This utility depends on the Swagger Documentation too.

1. Find `RESTEndpointsDocumenter.java` class.
2. Update the Jersey package info as input.
3. Confirm the UI asset files exist in the same path.
4. Execute the java class main method.
5. Open the output HTML fine which will have minimal Jersey api documentation. This page has URI fixed header with column grouping, search and paging features.
